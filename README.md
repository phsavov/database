This repository will hold all project files for the CS 4347 Semester Project


To download the exdecutable, go to target file and download the .jar file that appears in there. This is the executable for this project.
Then just open up the the .jar and then the software will work. If you want to also add stocks make sure that you have python installed on your
machine and make sure that you have flask installed. Run pip install flask in your terminal or command prompt to make sure that you have this library. 
As well as run pip intall pandas_datareader in your terminal as well for the same reasons as above.
